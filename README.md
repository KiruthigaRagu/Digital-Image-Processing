This repository consists of Digital image processing techniques applied over an image for preprocessing.

Digital image processing techniques are derived from the book:
https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Gonzalez-Digital-Image-Processing-4th-Edition/PGM241219.html

Implementation of digital image preprocessing techniques include,
<ul>
<li>Colour image processing</li>
<li>Image Enhancement using histogram equalization and histogram matching</li>
<li>Smoothing and sharpening filters</li>
<li>Spatial to frequency domain conversions</li>
<li>Application of filters in frequency domain</li>
<li>Image segmentation</li>
<li>Feature Analysis</li>
</ul>
